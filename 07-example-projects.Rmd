# Example Project: The Biscuit Study {#example-projects}

## Objective of the Test

The data set that we use as a main example throughout this book comes from a sensory study on biscuits. The study was part of the project BISENS funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR, programme ALIA 2008). These biscuits were developed for breakfast consumption and specifically designed to improve satiety.

The study was conducted in France with 107 consumers who tested a total of 10 biscuit recipes (including 9 experimental products varying in their fiber and protein contents), as fibers and proteins are known to increase satiety.  

The study aimed to measure the liking for these biscuits, its link with eaten quantities, and the evolution of hunger sensations over ad libitum consumption. All the volunteers therefore participated to 10 morning sessions in order to test every product (one biscuit type per session). After they completed all the sessions, they also filled a questionnaire about food-related personality traits such as cognitive restraint and sensitivity to hunger.  
Parallel to this, a panel of nine trained judges performed a quantitative descriptive analysis of the biscuits. They evaluated the same 10 products as well as an additional product whose recipe was optimized for liking and satiating properties.

Data from the biscuit study are gathered in three Excel files that can be accessed here [ADD LINK TO REPOSITORY HERE]:

* biscuits_sensory_profile.xlsx  
* biscuits_traits.xlsx  

## Products

In total, 11 products were considered in this study. They are all breakfast biscuits with varying contents of proteins and fibers (Table \@ref(tab:biscuit-set)). Products *P01* to *P09* are prototypes whereas product *P10* is a standard commercial biscuit without enrichment. The 11th product *Popt* is an additional optimized biscuit that has been evaluated only by the trained panel for descriptive analysis.

## Sensory Descriptive Analysis

A panel of 9 trained judges evaluated the 11 products on 32 sensory attributes (8 attributes for aspect, 3 for odor, 12 for flavor, and 9 for texture).  

Judges had received thorough training for the wider biscuit product category over more than six months on common vocabulary following conventional descriptive analysis standards [@iso1995sensory; @iso2012sensory]. Evaluation was performed in sensory booths in triplicates, although only individual means are available in this data set.

For each product, the judges reported the perceived intensity of each attribute using unstructured linear scales on a computer screen. Intensities were automatically converted by the acquisition system into a score ranging from 0 to 60. These data are stored in *biscuits_sensory_profile.xlsx*.

> In summary, the sensory data have 99 observations (11 *Products* × 9 *Judges*) and 34 variables (*Judge* and *Product* identifiers + 32 attributes).

## Consumer Test1

### Participants

107 women who were all regular consumers of breakfast biscuits participated in the test. The *biscuits_traits.xlsx* file gives information about their Body Mass Index (BMI) (Q4–Q6) and their socio-demographics (Q7–Q11: marital status, household, income, occupation, and highest degree).  
This file also gives participants' answers to a self-assessment questionnaire (Q12–62) that evaluates eating behavioral traits with emphasis on the tendency to control food intake cognitively. The questionnaire comprises a series of assertions about various eating situations in the respondent's daily life (e.g. "How...." answer Y/N"). Resulting scores are loaded into three factors: cognitive restraint (conscious restriction of food intake in order to control body weight or to promote weight loss), disinhibition (or emotional eating), and susceptibility to hunger (or uncontrolled eating, i.e. tendency to eat more than usual due to a loss of control over intake accompanied by feelings of hunger). This questionnaire is thus known as the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) [@stunkard1985] and is one of the most commonly used questionnaires to evaluate eating behaviors in relation to overweight or obesity [@blundell2010]. Calculation of these factors is detailed in Chapter \@ref(data-analysis).

> In summary, the data stored in *biscuits_traits.xlsx* have 107 observations and 62 variables giving multiple information about the consumers, including their sociodemographics, BMI, and TFEQ answers. Variable codes, names, and meaning are listed in the second sheet "Variables", with their corresponding levels in the third sheet "Levels".

### Test Design

The presentation order of the different products was randomized across the panel. Again, consumers evaluated one biscuit type per day/session. 

The design of the sessions is summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:test-design) with main measured variables. After they first rated their appetite sensations using visual analog scales (VAS), the participants tasted and rated one biscuit for liking. They were then served with a box of the same biscuits for _ad libitum_ consumption (with a maximum of 10 biscuits), followed by a new questionnaire regarding their liking, pleasure, and appetite sensations.

```

### Evaluation

The liking was measured with two different scales:  

1. with a horizontally oriented unstructured linear scale (i.e. VAS) anchored with *"I don’t like this biscuit at all"* (left end) and *"I like this biscuit a lot"* (right end) at two different times: after the first bite and at the end of their consumption.
2. with a vertically oriented semantic nine-point hedonic scale when stopping their consumption.  

VAS scales are frequently used in nutrition studies [@stubbs2000], whereas the nine-point hedonic scale is more popular in sensory and consumer science [@peryam1957; @wichchukit2015].  

Once done, the participants were asked about the reason(s) why they stopped eating (6 potential reasons rated with *Likert* scales ranging from *strongly disagree* to *strongly agree*). They were also asked how much they would like to eat other types of foods (11 food items rated using a VAS).

The time spent in the booth and the number of biscuits eaten by each participant were recorded by the experimenters, as well as the type of drink they selected and the approximate volume they drank during each session. These data are stored in *biscuits_consumer_test.xlsx*, in the second tab named *Time Consumption*.

> In summary, the consumer test data have 1070 observations (10 *Products* × 107 *Consumers*) and 32 variables (including *Consumer* and *Product* identifiers). The *biscuits_consumer_test.xlsx* file also includes one sheet with consumption time and the number of biscuits that consumers ate, and a sheet indicating the average weight for each product.
