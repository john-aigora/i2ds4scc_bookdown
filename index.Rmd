## Who Should Read This Book? {-}

This book is for practitioners or students of sensory and consumer science who want to participate in the emerging field of computational sensory science.  This book assumes little to no coding experience.  Some statistical experience will be helpful to understand the examples discussed.

## How to Use This Book {-}

This book is meant to be interactive, with the reader ideally typing and running all of the code presented in the parts labeled "Hors d'Oeurves" and "Bon App√©tit."  Computer languages are like human languages in that they need to be practiced to be learned, so we highly recommend the reader actually typing all of the code from these parts, running it, and verifying they receive the results shown in the book.  To help with this practice, we have created a [special GitHub repository](https://github.com/aigorahub/data_science_for_sensory_sample_code) that contains folders called `work_along` and `sample_code`.  Please see Appendix \@ref(start-R) for guidance on how to get started with R and GitHub.  In the the `sample_code` folder, we have included the code as presented in the book, while in the `work_along` folder we have provided blank files for each chapter that load the libraries^[You may need to load these libraries before the code will run, please see Appendix \@ref(start-R) for more information on this topic as well.].
