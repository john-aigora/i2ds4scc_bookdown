## Objectives

For good communication, importance of having the right tool.
Interactivity has always played an important role.
Even better, imagine you are presenting results to your manager and colleagues, and as questions arise, you have a tool that provide answers to most of their questions based on data.

or...

Introduce an experienced situation: I'm sure we've all been through situations in which we spend a lot of time analyzing data for a study, we build our story, spend time in perfecting our presentation: when comes the day of the presentation to your manager and colleagues, you get questions (e.g. how about a split between users/non users, or between gender, etc.) that you can only answer with: "let me re-run some analyses and I'll update you on that!"

Disappointment because 1) you did not think about it, 2) you know that you have to go through all your analyses again, but just on a portion of it...

What if we had a tool that would allow you to provide such results (up to a certain extent) instantly, as the question arises?
This is the role of dashboard: interactivity of results/representations based on updated data (filter, zoom in...) 

## Introduction to Shiny through an Example

To illustrate what a Shiny Application, we propose to build a simple application that will:
 - Import a data containing the results of a sensory test (*Sensory Profile.xlsx*)
 - Compute automatically the table of means by product for all the sensory attributes
 - Represent these profiles in either a spider plot, or a circular barchart
 - Provide the possibility to show/hide products
 - Possibility to show/hide and order the attributes
 - Allow downloading the final plot to our computer
 
Technicalities:
 - Allow importing a file to the application that is stored somewhere in our computer
 - The data file should have a certain structure: the Panelist and Product column should be called *Judge* and *Product*, and all the attributes should be sensory attributes (quantitative)
 - Create an option that controls the type of graph to create
 - Retrieve from the data imported the list of products and present it as a checkbox list
 - Retrieve from the data imported the list of attributes that can be re-arranged manually
 - Create and provide a way to save the final plot to your computer 

### What is Shiny

Shiny is an R package (`{shiny}`) that allows you to directly create from R interactive web applications. The goal of shiny is to 'convert' your R code into an application that can be accessible and used by anyone through your web browser, without seeing any line of code, nor without having to be familiar with R.

To so, `{shiny}` requires some carefully curated set of user interface (UI) functions that are s
