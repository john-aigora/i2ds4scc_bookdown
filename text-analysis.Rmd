# Text Analysis {#text-analysis}

## What is Text Analysis

*NLP* for *N*atural *L*anguage *P*rocessing

### What?
### Objectives of Text Analysis

Extract information from text
Transforming qualitative data into quantitative
Understanding connections between words, or between words and concepts (products)

### Examples of application

Open-ended comments (simplest form: CATA)
Topic oriented questions: *Why do you (dis)like this product?*
Reference to free-JAR (Alexiane Luc) and ideal from free comments (Benjamin Mahieu)

Specific description (Free Sorting Task, Napping) [Ref + thanks to Jacob Lahne data]

Social media
Web-scrapping
Corpus (documents, book, etc.)

Speech to text to analysis
Spam filters, text prediction (emails)

### Warnings

Complexity of words/sentences (example of a sentence with/without punctuation? or Twitter example?)

Text analysis can easily become tedious due to size of documents, double meanings of words, context (e.g. irony) etc.
That's why automating is and is not a good idea:
 - saves time, effort, and provide quick summary
 - loses part of abstracts things, which can lead to misinterpretations

## Illustration using Sorting Task Data

## Data Pre-processing

Use of `{tidytext}`
Also, have a look at `{Xplortext}`, or IRaMuTeQ (software using R in the background)
For basic stuff, look at `{SensoMineR}` and `textual()`

### Introduction to working with strings (`{forcats}`)
### Tokenization
### Simple Transformation (lowercase, punctuation)
### Stopwords
### Stemming and Lemmatization
### Word Embedding (?)

## Text Analysis

### Raw Frequencies

Incl. Wordclouds and CA

### Bigrams, *n*-grams

Including word graphs

### Cluster Analysis

## To go further...

Sentiment Analysis
Contrast Plot
Topic Modeling
Machine Learning



<!--
## Overview

## Key Topics

### Data Sources
### Working with Strings
### Tokenizing
### Lemmatization, stemming, and stop word removal
### Part of Speech Tagging

## Common Applications
### Frequency counts and summary statistics
### Word clouds
### Contrast plots
### Sentiment analysis
### Topic Modeling
### Bigrams and word graphs

## Code Examples

Introduction to **{tidytext}** and **{Xplortext}**

### Statistical entities

What are we considering as statistical entities?

- documents
- sentences
- words
- cleaned words

Depends on objectives of study and how data are being collected:

- directly from consumers in a CLT (directed questions)
- analysis of social media (e.g. twitter)
- web-scrapping from website

Discussion around CATA as a simplified version of text analysis...

#### Notion of tokenization

#### Cleaning the data

Notions of lemmatization, stemming, and stopwords removal

- grouping words
- removing stopwords
- tf-idf

### Analysis of Frequencies and term-frequency document

#### Contingency table

Presentation of the tf/contingency table

#### wordclouds

**{ggwordclouds}**

#### Correspondence Analysis

**{FactoMineR}** and **{Xplortext}**

### Futher Analysis of the words

#### Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis and its relationship to hedonic statement
Introduction to free-JAR?

#### Bi-grams and N-grams

Presentation of graph-theory applied to text mining

#### Machine learning
