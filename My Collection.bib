abstract = {Text data is important for many domains, from healthcare to marketing to the digital humanities, but specialized approaches are necessary to create features for machine learning from language. Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R explains how to preprocess text data for modeling, train models, and evaluate model performance using tools from the tidyverse and tidymodels ecosystem. Models like these can be used to make predictions for new observations, to understand what natural language features or characteristics contribute to differences in the output, and more. If you are already familiar with the basics of predictive modeling, use the comprehensive, detailed examples in this book to extend your skills to the domain of natural language processing. This book provides practical guidance and directly applicable knowledge for data scientists and analysts who want to integrate unstructured text data into their modeling pipelines. Learn how to use text data for both regression and classification tasks, and how to apply more straightforward algorithms like regularized regression or support vector machines as well as deep learning approaches. Natural language must be dramatically transformed to be ready for computation, so we explore typical text preprocessing and feature engineering steps like tokenization and word embeddings from the ground up. These steps influence model results in ways we can measure, both in terms of model metrics and other tangible consequences such as how fair or appropriate model results are.},

@article{Franczak2015,
abstract = {Liking studies are designed to ascertain consumers likes and dislikes on a variety of products. However, it can be undesirable to construct liking studies where each panelist evaluates every target product. In such cases, an incomplete-block design, where each panelist evaluates only a subset of the target products, can be used. These incomplete blocks are often balanced, so that all pairs occur the same number of times. While desirable in many situations, balanced incomplete blocks have the disadvantage that, by their nature, they cannot favor placing dissimilar products next to one another. A novel incomplete-block design is introduced that utilizes the target product's sensory profile to allocate products to each panelist so that they are, in general, as dissimilar as possible while also ensuring position balance. The resulting design is called a sensory informed design (SID). Herein, details on the formulation of SIDs are given. Data arising from these SIDs are analyzed using a simultaneous clustering and imputation approach, and the results are discussed.},

Mutually orthogonal latin squares can achieve this with much smaller numbers of consumers when t is a prime number or an integer power of a prime. In general subsets-designs balanced just for first-order carry-over may easily be constructed either by unfolding a full design or by combining them with incomplete block designs.

abstract = {Sensory descriptive analysis is one of the most powerful, sophisticated and most extensively used tools in sensory science, which provides a complete description of the sensory characteristics of food products. Considering the economic and time consuming aspects of training assessor panels for descriptive analysis, several novel methodologies for sensory characterization have been developed in the last ten years. These methodologies are less time consuming, more flexible and can be used with semi trained assessors and even consumers, providing sensory maps very close to a classic descriptive analysis with highly trained panels. Novel techniques are based on different approaches: methods based on the evaluation of individual attributes (intensity scales, check-all-that-apply questions or CATA, flash profiling, paired comparisons); methods based on the evaluation of global differences (sorting, projective mapping or Napping{\textregistered}); methods based on the comparison with product references (polarized sensory positioning), and based on a free, global evaluation of the individual products (Open-ended questions). This review aims at reviewing theory, implementation, advantages and disadvantages of the novel product profiling techniques developed in the last ten years, discussing recommendations for their application. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The 21st century has ushered in the age of big data and data economy, in which data DNA, which carries important knowledge, insights, and potential, has become an intrinsic constituent of all data-based organisms. An appropriate understanding of data DNA and its organisms relies on the new field of data science and its keystone, analytics. Although it is widely debated whether big data is only hype and buzz, and data science is still in a very early phase, significant challenges and opportunities are emerging or have been inspired by the research, innovation, business, profession, and education of data science. This article provides a comprehensive survey and tutorial of the fundamental aspects of data science: the evolution from data analysis to data science, the data science concepts, a big picture of the era of data science, the major challenges and directions in data innovation, the nature of data analytics, new industrialization and service opportunities in the data economy, the profession and competency of data education, and the future of data science.
