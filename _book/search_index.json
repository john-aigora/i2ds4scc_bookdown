Why Data Science for Sensory and Consumer Science?", " Chapter 1 Bienvenue! Why Data Science for Sensory and Consumer Science? One of the most exciting aspects of being a sensory and consumer scientist is having access to a wide range of data. Core principles in Sensory and Consumer Science Sensory and consumer science (SCS) is consider as a pillar of food science and technology and is useful to product development, quality control and market research. Most scientific and methodological advances in the field are applied to food. This book makes no exception as we chose a cookie formulation dataset as a main thread. However, SCS widely applies to many other consumer goods so are the content of this book and the principles set out below. Measuring and analyzing human responses Sensory and consumer science aims at measuring and understanding consumers sensory perceptions as well as the judgements, emotions and behaviors that may arise from these perceptions. SCS is thus primarily a science of measurement, although a very particular one that uses human beings and their senses as measuring instruments. In other words, sensory and consumer researchers measure and analyze human responses. To this end, SCS relies essentially on sensory evaluation which comprises a set of techniques that mostly derive from psychophysics and behavioral research. It uses psychological models to help separate signal from noise in collected data [ref OMahony, D.Ennis, others?]. Besides, sensory evaluation has developed its own methodological framework that includes most refined techniques for the accurate measurement of product sensory properties while minimizing the potentially biasing effects of brand identity and the influence of other external information on consumer perception [Lawless &amp; Heymann, 2010]. A detailed description of sensory methods is beyond the scope of this book and many textbooks on sensory evaluation methods are available to readers seeking more information. However, just to give a brief overview, it is worth remembering that sensory methods can be roughly divided into three categories, each of them bearing many variants: Discrimination tests that aim at detecting subtle differences between two products. Descriptive analysis (DA), also referred to as sensory profiling, aims at providing both qualitative and quantitative information about product sensory properties. Hedonic tests. This category gathers affective tests that aim at measuring consumers liking for the tested products or their preferences among a product set. Each of these test categories generates its own type of data and related statistical questions in relation to the objectives of the study. Typically, data from difference tests consist in series of correct/failed binary answers depending on whether judges successfully picked the odd sample(s) among a set of three or more samples. These are used to determine whether the number of correct choices is above the level expected by chance. Conventional descriptive analysis data consist in intensity scores given by each panelist to evaluated samples on a series of sensory attributes, hence resulting in a product x attribute x panelist dataset (Figure 1). Note that depending on the DA method, quantifying means other than intensity ratings can be used (ranks, frequency, etc.). Most frequently, each panelist evaluates all the samples in the product set. However, the use of balanced incomplete design can also be found when the experimenters aim to limit the number of samples evaluated by each subject. Eventually, hedonic test datasets consist in hedonic scores (ratings for consumers degree of liking or preference ranks) given by each interviewed consumer to a series of products. As for DA, each consumer usually evaluates all the samples in the product set, but balanced incomplete designs are sometimes used too. In addition, some companies favor pure monadic evaluation of product (i.e. between-subject design or independent groups design) which obviously result in unrelated sample datasets. Sensory and consumer researchers also borrow methods from other fields, in particular from sociology and experimental psychology. Definitely a multidisciplinary area, SCS develops in many directions and reaches disciplines that range from genetics and physiology to social marketing, behavioral economics and computational neuroscience. So have diversified the types of data sensory and consumer scientists must deal with.

In this chapter we explain what is data science and discuss why data science is valuable to sensory and consumer scientists. While this book focuses on the aspects of data science that are most important to sensory and consumer scientists, we recommend the excellent text Wickham and Grolemund (2016) for a more general introduction to data science. 2.1 History and Definition You may have heard that data science was called the sexiest job of the 21st century by Harvard Business Review (Davenport and Patil (2012)). But what is data science? Before we give our definition, we provide some brief history for context. For a comprehensive survey of this topic, we recommend Cao (2017). To begin, there was a movement in early computer science to call their field data science. Chief among the advocates for this viewpoint was Peter Naur, winner of the 2005 Turing award.1 This viewpoint is detailed in the preface to his 1974 book, Concise Survey of Computer Methods, where he states that data science is the science of dealing with data, once they have been established (Naur (1974)). According to Naur, this is the purpose of computer science. This viewpoint is echoed in the statement, often attributed to Edsger Dijkstr, that Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes. Interestingly, a similar viewpoint arose in statistics, as reflected in John Tukeys statements that Data analysis, and the parts of statistics which adhere to it, must  take on the characteristics of science rather than those of mathematics and that data analysis is intrinsically an empirical science (Tukey (1962)). This movement culminated in 1997 when Jeff Wu proposed during his inaugural lecture upon becoming the chair of the University of Michigans statistics department, entitled Statistics = Data Science?, that statistics should be called data science (Wu (1997)). These two movements2 came together in 2001 in William S. Clevelands paper Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas in the Field of Statistics (Cleveland (2001)). In this highly influential monograph, Cleveland makes the key assertion that The value of technical work is judged by the extent ot which it benefits the data analyst, either directly or indirectly. Based on this history, we provide our definition of data science: Data science is the intersection of statistics, computer science, and industrial design. Accordingly, we use the following three definitions of these fields: Statistics: The branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of masses of numerical data. Computer Science: Computer science is the study of processes that interact with data and that can be represented as data in the form of programs. Industrial Design: The professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer. Hence data science is the delivery of value through the collection, processing, analysis, and interpretation of data. 2.2 Benefits of Data Science Now that we have a working definition of data science, we consider some reasons for sensory and consumer scientists to embrace it. 2.2.1 Reproducible Research One of the most important ideas in data science is that of reproducible research (cf. Peng (2011)). Importantly, reproducibility in the context of data science does not refer to the repeatability of the experimental results themselves if the experiment were to be conducted again. What is instead meant by reproducible research is the ability to proceed from the input data to the final results in reproducible steps. Ideally, these steps should be well-documented so that any future researcher, including the researcher who originally conducted the work, should be able to determine all choices made in data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis that led to the final results. Since sensory and consumer scientists often work in teams, this clarity ensures that anyone on the team can understand the steps that led to prior results were obtained, and can apply those steps to their own research going forward. 2.2.2 Standardized Reporting Related to the idea of reproducible research is that of standardized reporting. By following a data-scientific workflow, including automated reporting (see Chapter 6), we can standardize our reporting across multiple projecsts. This standardization has many benefits: Consistent Formatting When standardized reporting is used, outputs created by a team are formatted consistently regardless of who creates them. This consistency helps consumers of the reports - whether those consumers are executives, clients, or other team members - quickly interpret results. Upstream Data Consistency Once a standardized workflow is put in place, consistency of data formatting gains a new importance as producers of the report can save significant time by not having to reformat new data. This fact puts pressure on the data collection produce to become more consistent, which ultimately supports knowledge management (see Chapter 17). Shared Learning Once a team combines standardized reporting with tools for online collaboration such as GitHub (see Appendix A.4), any improvement to reporting (for example, to a table, chart, text output, or even to the reporting format itself) can be leveraged by all members of the team. Thus improvements compound over time, to the benefit of all team members. 2.2.3 Data-Driven Decision Making 2.2.4 Standardized Data Collection 2.2.5 Improved Business Impact 2.3 Data Scientific Workflow A schematic of a data scientific workflow is shown in Figure 2.1. Each section is described in greater detail below.

Our advice based on mentoring many students and clients is to get started sooner rather than later, and to accept that the code youll write in the future will always be better than the code youll write today. Also, many of the small details that separate an proficient data scientist from a novice can only really be learned through practice as there are too many small details to learn them all in advice. So, starting today, do your best to write at least some code for all your projects. If a time deadline prevents you from completing the analysis in R, thats fine, but at least gain the experience of making an RStudio project and loading the data in R. Then, as time allows, try to duplicate your analyses in R, being quick to search for solutions when you run into errors. Often simply copying and pasting your error into a search engine will be enough to find the solution to your problem. Moreover, searching for solutions is its own skill that also requires practice. Finally, if you are really stuck, reach out to a colleague (or even the authors of this book) for help We recommend following the instructions in Appendix A to get started. A prize roughly equivalent in prestige to a Nobel prize, but for computer science. It is worth noting that these two movements were connected by substantial work in the areas of statistical computing, knowledge discovery, and data mining, with important work contributed by Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro, Usama Fayyad, and Padhraic Smyth among many others. See Fayyad, Piatetsky-Shapiro, and Smyth (1996), for example. "],["tidy-thoughts.html", "Chapter 3 Tidy Thinking", " Chapter 3 Tidy Thinking This is a test of the footnotes3. A great footnote "],["data-manip.html", "Chapter 4 Data Manipulation 4.1 Tidying Data 4.2 Illustration", " Chapter 4 Data Manipulation In sensory science, different data collection tools (whether it is device, software, or methodologies) may provide data in different formats. Also, different statistical analyses may require having the same data structured in a different way. A simple example to illustrate this later point is the analysis of liking data. Let C consumers provide their hedonic assessments of P samples. To evaluate if samples have been liked differently, an ANOVA is performed on a long thin table with (PxC) rows x 3 columns (consumer, sample, and the liking scores). However, to assess whether consumers have the same preference patterns at the individual level, internal preference mapping or cluster analysis would be performed, and both these analyses require as input a short and large table with P rows and C columns. Another example of data manipulation consists in summarizing data, by for instance computing the mean by product for each sensory attribute (hence creating the so-called sensory profiles), or to generate frequency tables (e.g. proportions of male/female, distribution of the liking scores by sample, contingency table for CATA data, etc.) For these reasons, it is hence essential to learn to manipulate data and transition from one structure to another. For illustration, lets consider the data stored in Sensory Profile.xlsx, which consists in 9 panellists evaluating 11 samples on 32 sensory attributes. This dataset will be further analysed in the following sections. The aim here is not to interpret the results, but to show how data is being manipulated. This data is imported using the read_xlsx() function from the {readxl} package (for more information on how to import data, see Section 8). A first analysis that is commonly done on such table consists in computing the mean per sample for each attribute, hence generating the so-called sensory profiles of the samples. Such table (crossing the samples in rows and the sensory attributes in columns) gives a first impression at the differences between samples across attributes. The principles of data manipulation will be illustrated here by generating the sensory profiles from the raw data using different approaches. This step consists in reducing the 99x35 table into a 11x33 table, i.e. a table with 11 rows (one per sample) and 32 columns (one per attribute) and one column with the sample information. An important message here is that most data transformation situation can be solved in different ways, so dont be afraid to open your mind and think differently by stimulating your imagination to solve any of your data challenge. Note that we could consider passing the sample names as row names rather than having it as an extra column. This extra step is required for certain functions from {FactoMineR} and {SensoMineR} for instance, and will be presented in Section 9. 4.1 Tidying Data 4.1.1 Transformation without Altering the Data Transforming a data table without altering the data itself is done through pivoting, hence either creating a shorter and wider table (CREATE FIGURE), or a longer and thinner table (CREATE FIGURE). This is done through the pivot_wider() and pivot_longer() functions from the {tidyr} package. 4.1.2 Transformation that Alters the Data In some cases, the final table to generate requires altering the data, by (say) computing the mean across multiple values, or counting the number of occurrences of factor levels for instance. In other words, we summarize the information, which also tend to reduce the size of the table. It is hence no surprise that the function used for such data reduction is called summarise() from the {dplyr} package. In practice, summarise() applies a function (whether it is the mean(), or a simple count using n()) on a set of values. When this set of values need to be aggregated based on another variable (say we do not want to compute the overall mean for the entire table, but the mean by product), summarise() is then coupled with group_by(). 4.1.3 Handling Lists of Tables Create an example with multiple dataset in one excel sheet (could be different countries, or different sessions) Import the data using map() by reading the different tabs Use enframe() to combine all the results (alternative: use reduce() with bind_rows(), but this version will lose the country names/session info if not already part of the dataset) nest_by() and unnest_by() enframe() and deframe() reduce() rowwise() and mutate() separate_rows() to link to unnest_tokens() 4.2 Illustration Although the solutions we just presented are simple and only involve a few lines of code, we propose other solutions using the {tidyverse}. This will allow us introducing this philosophy of coding, and will provide you a first contact to some of the functions that we use. The {tidyverse} operates 5 major transformations on a dataset: select() allows selecting, renaming, and re-arranging columns of a dataset; filter() and arrange() works on the rows of the dataset by filtering data and rearranging the order; mutate() adds new columns, which can be the combination of other columns of the dataset; summarise() summarises the data by providing the statistics of interest on the variables selected (all the variables that are not specified are then removed). Note that for mutate() and summarise(), different variant such as mutate_all() or mutate_if() (resp. summarise_all() and summarise_if()) allows applying the same transformation to multiple columns (all the columns for mutate_all() and summarise_all(), or the one that meet a pre-defined condition for mutate_if() and summarise_if()). As a first proposition, we use summarise_all, meaning that we should only keep the variables that are relevant for the analysis. From sensory, we hence select the columns 3 (product), and the block starting from column 4 until the end of the dataset (sensory attributes). Since the mean needs to be computed for each sample separately, the function group_by() is used. This function ensures that the results are summarised by product in our case. We then summarise the data by performing the mean on all the variables (product is ignored since it is used to group the results). Ultimately, we use the product names as row names (using column_to_rownames()). senso_mean2 &lt;- sensory %&gt;% dplyr::select(3,4:ncol(sensory)) %&gt;% group_by(product) %&gt;% summarise_all(list(~mean(.))) %&gt;% column_to_rownames(var=&quot;product&quot;) round(senso_mean2, 2) The transformation from the original 11x35 table to the 11x33 table is done through the group_by() followed by summarise_all functions. Another way of generating such table consists in not pre-selecting the variables, but in computing the mean only if the variable is numerical. To do so, we use summarise_if() and we put the condition that the variable should be numerical to compute the mean (otherwise R will return an error). Here again, we group the results by product. senso_mean3 &lt;- sensory %&gt;% group_by(product) %&gt;% summarise_if(is.numeric, mean) %&gt;% column_to_rownames(var=&quot;product&quot;) round(senso_mean3, 2) This solution fits well if all the variables that are numeric should be summarized in the same way (here using the mean). Otherwise, a good solution is to run the analysis on a pre-defined set of variables. Such set can be created manually (we are taking the first 10 sensory attributes here), or automatically if the names of the attributes follow a certain pattern. In such case, the use of functions such as starts_with(), ends_with(), or using regular expression is of great help! The mean table is then generated using the summarise() function across() all_of() the variables that were selected. senso_var &lt;- colnames(sensory)[4:13] senso_mean4 &lt;- sensory %&gt;% group_by(product) %&gt;% summarise(across(all_of(senso_var), mean)) %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% column_to_rownames(var=&quot;product&quot;) round(senso_mean4, 2) At last, we propose a solution which in this case is not optimal, but which can be very useful in some others. This solution consists in working on the dataset by permuting all the variables using pivot_longer(), hence generating a dataset with 3 relevant columns: one containing the products, one containing all the attributes, and one containing the scores. On this variable, we summarise() the scores by product and by attribute, before re-structuring the data using pivot_wider(). Note that the combination pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() will re-organize automatically the attributes alphabetically. To avoid that, we can transform the column we name attribute into a factor with as level order the original order. This procedure maintains the original order. senso_mean5 &lt;- sensory %&gt;% pivot_longer(4:ncol(.), names_to=&quot;attributes&quot;, values_to=&quot;scores&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(attributes = factor(attributes, levels=colnames(sensory)[4:ncol(sensory)])) %&gt;% group_by(product, attributes) %&gt;% summarise(scores = mean(scores)) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from=attributes, values_from=scores) %&gt;% column_to_rownames(var=&quot;product&quot;) round(senso_mean5, 2) This procedure uses intermediate steps since the structure of the original table (99x35) is transformed by pivoting the attributes from columns to rows: this means that after pivot_wider(), the dataset created now contains 99x32=3168 rows and 5 columns (judge, code, and product, one column called attributes which contains the attribute names, and one column called scores which contain the individual scores). This table is then reduced to a table 11x32=352 rows and 3 columns (product, attributes, scores) through the group_by() and summarise() process, before being reset as 11x33 table through pivot_wider(). This procedure could slightly be simplified: To generate senso_mean5, we computed the mean by product and attributes across all assessors. If we delete this line of code (i.e. related to summary), R will generate a table crossing product in rows, attributes in columns, in which each cell contains a list of values (here, we have as many values as we have assessors performing the test in each cell). When such situation appears, it is possible to apply automatically a function (here we want the mean()) on this sets of values using values_fn from pivot_wider(). senso_mean6 &lt;- sensory %&gt;% pivot_longer(4:ncol(.), names_to=&quot;attribute&quot;, values_to=&quot;scores&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(attribute = factor(attribute, levels=colnames(sensory)[4:ncol(sensory)])) %&gt;% dplyr::select(-judge, -code) %&gt;% group_by(product, attribute) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from=attribute, values_from=scores, values_fn=mean) %&gt;% column_to_rownames(var=&quot;product&quot;) round(senso_mean6, 2) In a similar way, missing values can be replaced automatically using values_fill. As expected, all these solutions provide the same sensory profiles using different process. Depending on the situations, some of these processes may be better than others. Note that multiple analysis can be ordered together. Lets take back the example generating senso_mean4, and lets consider 2 other groups of variables, one in which we ask for the median, and one for which we ask the number of measures. This entire table can be generated as such: senso_var1 &lt;- colnames(sensory)[4:13] senso_var2 &lt;- colnames(sensory)[14:20] senso_var3 &lt;- colnames(sensory)[21:25] senso_multifun &lt;- sensory %&gt;% group_by(product) %&gt;% summarise(across(all_of(senso_var1), mean), across(all_of(senso_var2), median), across(all_of(senso_var3), length)) %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% column_to_rownames(var=&quot;product&quot;) round(senso_multifun, 2) "],["data-viz.html", "Chapter 5 Data Visualization 5.1 Design Principles 5.2 Table Making 5.3 Chart Making", " Chapter 5 Data Visualization 5.1 Design Principles 5.2 Table Making 5.3 Chart Making 5.3.1 Philosophy of ggplot2 Explain the principles of multi-layer graphs through an example. aes(), geom_(), theme() 5.3.1.1 aesthetics Provide the most relevant options for aes() x, y, z group color, fill text, label alpha, size 5.3.1.2 geom_ Explain the fact that some geom_() comes with some stats automatically (e.g. geom_bar bins the data) 5.3.2 Common Charts 5.3.2.1 Scatter points geom_point() 5.3.2.2 Line charts geom_line(), geom_smooth() geom_abline() geom_hline() and geom_vline() geom_segment() and geom_arrow() 5.3.2.3 Bar charts geom_bar, geom_polygon, geom_histogram(), geom_freqpoly() position=\"identity\", position=\"dodge\" or position=\"fill\" 5.3.2.4 Distribution geom_boxplot() and geom_violin() 5.3.2.5 Text geom_text and geom_label presentation of {ggrepel} 5.3.2.6 Rectangles geom_tile(), geom_rect, and geom_raster() 5.3.2.7 Themes and legend theme(), and pre-defined themes like theme_bw(), theme_minimal(), etc. ggtitle() xlab(), ylab(), or labs() 5.3.3 Additional Topics 5.3.3.1 Playing around with axes coord_fixed(), coord_cartesian(), coord_trans() scale_x_, scale_y_ 5.3.3.2 Transposing the plot coord_flip() and coord_polar() 5.3.3.3 Splitting plots facet_wrap(), facet_grid() 5.3.3.4 Combining plots {patchwork} "],["auto-report.html", "Chapter 6 Automated Reporting 6.1 What is Automated Reporting? 6.2 Excel 6.3 PowerPoint 6.4 Word", " Chapter 6 Automated Reporting Effective communication of results is among the essential duties of the sensory scientist, but the sometimes tedious mechanics of report production together with the sheer volume of data that many scientists now must process combine to make reporting design an afterthought in too many cases. In this tutorial, we review recent advances in automated report production that liberate resources for scientists to focus on the interpretation and communication of results, while simultaneously reducing errors and increasing the consistency of their analyses. We teach the tutorial through an extended example, cumulatively building an R script that takes participates from receipt of an example dataset to a beautifully-designed and nearly completed PowerPoint presentation automatically and using freely available, open-source packages.

Packages for formatting extrafont extrafontdb Rcolorbrewer 6.2 Excel Although Excel is not our preferred tool for automated reporting, it is still one of the major ways to access and share data. Most data collection software offers the possibility to export data and/or results in an Excel format, and most data analysis tools accepts Excel format as inputs. With the large use of Excel, it is no surprise that many of our colleagues or clients like to share data and results using such spreadsheets. It is even less a surprise that R provides multiple solutions to import/export results from/to Excel. For the importation of datasets, we have already presented two packages ({xlsx} and {readxl}) which provide some interesting options: they will not be detailed any further here. For exporting results, two complementary packages (amongst others) in terms of ease of use and flexibility in the outcome are considered: {xlsx} and {openxlsx}. Besides its option of importing directly Excel files (.xls and .xlsx), the package {xlsx} also offers the option to export tables in Excel through the function write.xlsx(). write.xlsx() works in the same way as base::write.csv() (as its name indicates, this function exports tables from R to a .csv file), but since it generates an Excel file (.xls or .xlsx), additional tabs can be added using the append option. The procedure for write.xlsx() is the following: First export the table x=mydata1 of interest in a new Excel into the tab entitles mytab1 of the file myfile.xlsx using the options file=myfile.xlsx and sheetName= mytab1, and set the option append=FALSE. Then add to file=myfile.xlsx any additional table x=mydata2 in another tab (e.g. sheet=mytab2) using a similar command, but by setting append=TRUE. By doing so, R understands that myfile.xlsx should be extended with a second tab called mytab2 that contains mytable2. The tables exported may or may not include row names and column namess, and the sheet can automatically be password protected using the password option. library(xlsx) # We propose here to export the 5 first tables in 5 different tabs. for (v in 1:5){ if (v==1){ append=FALSE } else { append=TRUE } xlsx::write.xlsx(as.data.frame(demog_freq[[v]]), file=&quot;thierry_code/Output/Tables using xlsx.xlsx&quot;, sheetName=names(demog_freq)[v], row.names=FALSE, append=append) } The exportation of tables using the {xlsx} package is easy, yet very simplistic as it does not allow formatting the tables, nor does it allow exporting multiple tables in the same tab. For more advanced exporting options, the use of {openxlsx} package is preferred as it allows more flexibility in structuring and formatting the Excel output. With {openxlsx}, the procedure starts with creating a workbook wb using the createWorkbook() function, to which we add worksheets through the addWorksheet() function. On a given worksheet, any table can be exported using writeData() or writeDataTable(), which controls where to write the table through the startRow and startCol options. Through these different functions, many additional formatting procedure can be applied: createWorksheet() allows: show/hide grid lines using gridLines; colour the specific sheet using tabColour; change the zoom on the sheet through zoom; show/hide the tab using visible; format the worksheet by specifying its size (paperSize) and orientation (orientation). writeData() and writeDataTable() allow: controlling where to print the data using startRow and startCol (or alternatively xy: xy=c(B,12) prints the table in cell B12), hence allowing exporting multiple tables within the same tab; including the row names and column names through rowNames and colNames; formatting the header using headerStyle (incl. colour of the text and/or background, font, font size, etc.) and whether a filter should be applied; shaping the borders using predefined solutions through borders, or customizing them with borderStyle and borderColour; adding a filter to the table using withFilger; converts missing data to #N/A or any other string using keepNA and na.string. Additional formatting can be controlled using: options() to predefine number formatting, border colours and style that will be applied automatically to each tables; modifyBaseFont() to defined the font and font size; freezePane() to freeze the first row and/or column of the table using firstRow=TRUE and firstCol=TRUE; createStyle() to pre-define a style, or addStyle() to apply a later stage some styling to some cells; controls the width of the columns using setColWidths; conditionalFormatting() allows coloring cells when they meet pre-defined rules, as for instance to highlight significant p-values. When using {openxlsx}, we recommend to use the same procedure as for Word and PowerPoint: Start with setting as default the parameters that should be applied to each table; Create styles for text or table headers that you save in different elements, and that you apply where needed. In the following example, the sensory profiles are exported in the first tab, and a set of frequency tables are exported in the second tab. To introduce conditional formatting with {openxlsx}, the sensory profiles are color coded as following: For each cell, the value is compared to the overall mean computed for that column and is colored in red (resp. blue) if its higher (resp. lower) than the mean. In practice, the color style is pre-defined in two parameters called pos_style (red) and neg_style (blue) using createStyle(). The decision whether pos_style or neg_style should be used is defined by the rule parameter from the conditionalFormatting()4 function. library(openxlsx) # Pre-define options to control the borders options(&quot;openxlsx.borderColour&quot;=&quot;#4F80BD&quot;) options(&quot;openxlsx.borderStyle&quot;=&quot;thin&quot;) # Automatically set Number formats to 3 values after the decimal options(&quot;openxlsx.numFmt&quot;=&quot;0.000&quot;) # Change the font to Calibri size 10 modifyBaseFont(wb, fontSize=10, fontName=&quot;Calibri&quot;) # Create a header style in which # the text is centered and in bold, # borders on top and on the bottom, # a blue background is used. headSty &lt;- createStyle(fgFill=&quot;#DCE6F1&quot;, border=&quot;TopBottom&quot;, halign=&quot;center&quot;, textDecoration=&quot;bold&quot;) # Preparing the colouring for the conditional formatting senso_mean &lt;- sensory %&gt;% group_by(product) %&gt;% summarise_if(is.numeric, mean) %&gt;% column_to_rownames(var=&quot;product&quot;) overall_mean &lt;- apply(senso_mean, 2, mean) pos_style &lt;- createStyle(fontColour=&quot;firebrick3&quot;, bgFill=&quot;mistyrose1&quot;) neg_style &lt;- createStyle(fontColour=&quot;navy&quot;, bgFill=&quot;lightsteelblue&quot;) # Creation of the workbook wb with two tabs called Mean and Frequency wb &lt;- openxlsx::createWorkbook() addWorksheet(wb, sheetName=&quot;Mean&quot;, gridLines=FALSE) addWorksheet(wb, sheetName=&quot;Frequency&quot;, gridLines=FALSE) # Exporting senso_mean to the first tab (first row and first column are frozen) # A pre-defined Excel design called TableStyleLight9 is used for this table freezePane(wb, sheet=1, firstRow=TRUE, firstCol=TRUE) writeDataTable(wb, sheet=1, x=senso_mean, colNames=TRUE, rowNames=TRUE, tableStyle=&quot;TableStyleLight9&quot;) for (v in 1:ncol(senso_mean1)){ conditionalFormatting(wb, 1, cols=v+1, rows=(1:nrow(senso_mean1)+1), rule = paste0(&quot;&gt;&quot;,overall_mean[[v]]), style = pos_style) conditionalFormatting(wb, 1, cols=v+1, rows=(1:nrow(senso_mean1)+1), rule = paste0(&quot;&lt;&quot;,overall_mean[[v]]), style = neg_style) } # Here, we export many different frequency tables in the second tab by: # 1. adding a title prior to the table # 2. export the table under its title # 3. title_r and next_r are used to track where the text is being printed writeData(wb, 2, x=&quot;Frequency Tables&quot;, startRow=1, startCol=2) title_r &lt;- 3 for (v in 1:5){ writeData(wb, 2, x=names(demog_freq)[v], startRow=max(title_r), startCol=1) writeData(wb, 2, x=demog_freq[[v]], startRow=max(title_r)+1, startCol=1, rowNames=FALSE, borders=&quot;surrounding&quot;, headerStyle=headSty) next_r &lt;- max(title_r) + 1 + 1 + nrow(demog_freq[[v]]) + 1 title_r &lt;- c(title_r, next_r) } # We apply different style for the main title and for each table&#39;s title. addStyle(wb, 2, style=createStyle(fontSize=14, textDecoration=&quot;bold&quot;), rows=1, cols=2) addStyle(wb, 2, style=createStyle(fontSize=12, textDecoration=&quot;italic&quot;), rows=title_r, cols=rep(1,length(title_r))) setColWidths(wb, 2, cols=1:10, widths=12) The file is created using saveWorkbook() by specifying the name of the workbook wb and its path through file.

"],["example-projects.html", "Chapter 7 Example Projects", " Chapter 7 Example Projects "],["data-collection.html", "Chapter 8 Data Collection 8.1 Design 8.2 Execute 8.3 Import", " Chapter 8 Data Collection 8.1 Design 8.2 Execute 8.3 Import To analyze data, we need data. If this data is already available in R, then the analysis can be performed directly. However, in much cases, the data is stored outside the R environment, and needs to be imported. In practice, the data might be stored in as many format as one can imagine, whether it ends up being a fairly common solution (.txt file, .csv file, or .xls/.xlsx file), or software specific (e.g. Stata, SPSS, etc.). Since it is very common to store the data in Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx) due to its simplicity, the emphasis is on this solution. Fortunately, most generalities presented for Excel files also apply to other formats through base::read.table() for .txt files, base::read.csv() and base::read.csv2() for .csv files, or through the {read} package (which is part of the {tidyverse}). For other (less common) formats, the reader can find packages that would allow importing their files into R. Particular interest can be given to the package {rio} (rio stands for R Input and Output) which provides an easy solution that 1. can handle a large variety of files, 2. can actually guess the type of file it is, and 3. provides tools to import, export, and convert almost any type of data format, including .csv, .xls and .xlsx, or data from other statistical software such as SAS (.sas7bdat and .xpt), SPSS (.sav and .por), or Stata (.dta). As an alternative, the package {foreign} provides functions that allow importing data stored from other statistical software (incl. Minitab, S, SAS, Stata, SPSS, etc.) Although Excel is most likely one of the most popular way of storing data, there are no {base} functions that allow importing such files easily. Fortunately, many packages have been developed in that purpose, including {XLConnect}, {xlsx}, {gdata}, and {readxl}. Due to its convenience and speed of execution, we will be using {readxl} here. 8.3.1 Importing Structured Excel File First, lets import the Sensory Profile.xlsx workbook using the readxl::read_xlsx() file, by informing as parameter the location of the file (informed in file_path using the package {here}) and the sheet we want to read from. This file is called structured as all the relevant information is already stored in the same sheet in a structured way. In other words, no decoding is required here, and there are no unexpected rows or columns (e.g. empty lines, or lines with additional information regarding the data but that is not data): The first row within the Data sheet of Sensory Profile.xlsx contains the headers, From the second row onwards, only data is being stored. Since this data will be used for some analyses, it is assigned data to an R object called sensory. To ensure that the importation went well, we print sensory to see how it looks like. Since {readxl} has been developed by Hadley Wickham and colleagues, its functions follow the {tidyverse} principles and the dataset thus imported is a tibble. Lets take advantage of the printing properties of a tibble to evaluate sensory: sensory sensory is a tibble with 99 rows and 35 columns that includes the Judge information (first column, defined as character), the Product information (second and third columns, defined as character), and the sensory attributes (fourth column onward, defined as numerical or dbl). 8.3.2 Importing Unstructured Excel File In some cases, the dataset is not so well organized/structured, and may need to be decoded. This is the case for the workbook entitled TFEQ.xlsx. For this file: The variables name have been coded and their corresponding names (together with some other valuable information we will be using in the next chapter) are stored in a different sheet entitled Variables; The different levels of each variable (including their code and corresponding names) are stored in another sheet entitled Levels. To import and decode this dataset, multiple steps are required: Import the variables name only; Import the information regarding the levels; Import the dataset without the first line of header, but by providing the correct names obtained in the first step; Decode each question (when needed) by replacing the numerical code by their corresponding labels. Lets start with importing the variables names from TFEQ.xlsx (sheet Variables) In a similar way, lets import the information related to the levels of each variable, stored in the Levels sheet. A deeper look at the Levels sheet shows that only the coded names of the variables are available. In order to include the final names, var_names is joined (using inner_join). library(tidyverse) var_labels &lt;- read_xlsx(file_path, sheet=&quot;Levels&quot;) %&gt;% inner_join(dplyr::select(var_names, Code, Name), by=c(Question=&quot;Code&quot;)) var_labels Note: In some cases, this information is directly available in the dataset as sub-header: A solution is then to import the first rows of the dataset that contain this information using the parameter n_max from `readxl::read_xlsx``. For each variable (when information is available), store that information as a list of tables that contains the code and their corresponding label. Finally, the dataset (Data) is imported by substituting the coded names with their corresponding names. This process can be done by skipping reading the first row of the dataset that contains the coded header (skip=1), and by passing Var_names as header or column names (after ensuring that the names sequence perfectly match across the two tables!). The data has now the proper header, however each variable is still coded numerically. The steps to convert the numerical values with their corresponding labels is shown in Section 9.

First, since read_xlsx() returns a tibble, we can take advantage of its printing properties to get a fill of the data at hand, TFEQ_data Other informative solutions consists in printing a summary of the data through the summary() function, or looking at its type and first values using str(). However, due to its richness of the outputs, we prefer to use the skim() function from the {skimr} package. library(skimr) skim(TFEQ_data) 9.1.2 Design Inspection Evaluate if the design is complete/incomplete Frequencies and cross-frequencies (simple statistics and simple graphs) 9.1.3 Missing Data Inspection Are there NAs? If yes, are they structured of random? 9.2 Clean 9.2.1 Renaming Variables renaming columns using rename() or select() 9.2.2 Handling Data Type In R, the variables can be of different types, going from numerical to nominal to binary etc. This section aims in presenting the most common types (and their properties) used in sensory and consumer studies, and in showing how to transform a variable from one type to another. Remember that when your dataset is a tibble (as is the case here), the type of each variable is provided as sub-header when printed on screen. This eases the work of the analyst as the variables type can be assessed at any moment. In case the dataset is not in a tibble, the use of the str() function used previously becomes handy as it provides this information. In sensory and consumer research, the four most common types are: Numerical (incl. integer or int, decimal or dcl, and double or dbl); Logical or lgl; Character or char; Factor or fct. R still has plenty of other types, for more information please visit: https://tibble.tidyverse.org/articles/types.html 9.2.2.1 Numerical Data Since a large proportion of the research done is quantitative, it is no surprise that our dataset are often dominated with numerical variables. In practice, numerical data includes integer (non-fractional number, e.g. 1, 2, -16, etc.), or decimal value (or double, e.g. 1.6, 2.333333, -3.2 etc.). By default, when reading data from an external file, R converts any numerical variables to integer unless decimal points are detected, in which case it is converted into double. Do we want to show how to format R wrt the number of decimals? (e.g. options(digits=2)) 9.2.2.2 Binary Data Another common type that seem to be numerical in appearance, but that has additional properties is the binary type. Binary data is data that takes two possible values (TRUE or FALSE), and are often the results of a test (e.g. is x&gt;3? Or is MyVar numerical?). A typical example of binary data in sensory and consumer research is data collected through Check-All-That-Apply (CATA) questionnaires. Note: Intrinsically, binary data is numerical, TRUE being assimilated to 1, FALSE to 0. If multiple tests are being performed, it is possible to sum the number of tests that pass using the sum() function, as shown in the simple example below: set.seed(123456) # Generating 10 random values between 1 and 10 using the uniform distribution x &lt;- runif(10, 1, 10) x # Test whether the values generated are strictly larger than 5 test &lt;- x&gt;5 test # Counting the number of values strictly larger than 5 sum(test) 9.2.2.3 Nominal Data Nominal data is any data that is not numerical. In most cases, nominal data are defined through text, or strings. It can appear in some situations that nominal variables are still defined with numbers although they do not have a numerical meaning. This is for instance the case when the respondents or samples are identified through numerical codes: In that case, it is clear that respondent 2 is not twice larger than respondent 1 for instance. But since the software cannot guess that those numbers are identifiers rather than numbers, the variables should be declared as nominal. The procedure explaining how to convert the type of the variables will be explained in the next section. For nominal data, two particular types of data are of interest: Character or char; Factor or fct. Variables defined as character or factor take strings as input. However, these two types differ in terms of structure of their levels: For character, there are no particular structure, and the variables can take any values (e.g. open-ended question); For factor, the inputs of the variables are structured into levels. To evaluate the number of levels, different procedure are required: For character, one should count the number of unique element using length() and unique(); For factor, the levels and the number of levels are direcly provided by levels() and nlevels(). Lets compare a variable set as factor and character by using the Judge column from TFEQ_data: example &lt;- TFEQ_data %&gt;% dplyr::select(Judge) %&gt;% mutate(Judge_fct = as.factor(Judge)) summary(example) unique(example$Judge) length(unique(example$Judge)) levels(example$Judge_fct) nlevels(example$Judge_fct) Although Judge and Judge_fct look the same, they are structurally different, and those differences play an important role that one should consider when running certain analyses, or building tables and graphs. When set as character, the number of levels of a variable is directly read from the data, and its levels order would either match the way they appear in the data, or are ordered alphabetically. This means that any data collected using a structured scale will lose its natural order. When set as factor, the number and order of the factor levels are informed, and does not depend on the data itself: If a level has never been selected, or if certain groups have been filtered, this information is still present in the data. To illustrate this, lets re-arrange the levels from Judge_fct by ordering them numerically in such a way J2 follows J1 rather than J10. judge &lt;- str_sort(levels(example$Judge_fct),numeric=TRUE) judge levels(example$Judge_fct) &lt;- judge Now the levels are sorted, lets remove some respondents by only keeping the 20 first ones (J1 to J20, as J18 does not exist), and re-run the previous code: example &lt;- TFEQ_data %&gt;% dplyr::select(Judge) %&gt;% mutate(Judge_fct = as.factor(Judge)) %&gt;% filter(Judge %in% paste0(&quot;J&quot;,1:20)) dim(example) unique(example$Judge) length(unique(example$Judge)) levels(example$Judge_fct) nlevels(example$Judge_fct) After filtering some respondents, it can be noticed that the variable set as character only contains 19 elements, whereas the column set as factor still contains the 107 respondents (most of them not having any recordings). This property can be seen as an advantage or a disadvantage depending on the situation: For frequencies, it may be relevant to remember all the options, including the ones that may never be selected, and to order the results logically (use of factor). For hypothesis testing (e.g. ANOVA) on subset of data (e.g. the data being split by gender), the Judge variable set as character would have the correct number of degrees of freedom (18 in our example) whereas the variable set as factor would use 106 degrees of freedom in all cases! The latter point is particularly critical since the analysis is incorrect and will either return an error or worse return erroneous results! Last but not least, variables defined as factor allow having their levels being renamed (and eventually combined) very easily. Lets consider the Living area variable from TFEQ_data as example. From the original excel file, it can be seen that it has three levels, 1 corresponding to urban area, 2 to rurban area, and 3 to rural area. Lets start by renaming this variable accordingly: example = TFEQ_data %&gt;% mutate(Area = factor(`Living area`, levels=c(1,2,3), labels=c(&quot;Urban&quot;, &quot;Rurban&quot;, &quot;Rural&quot;))) levels(example$Area) nlevels(example$Area) table(example$`Living area`, example$Area) As can be seen, the variable Area is the factor version (including its labels) of Living area. If we would also consider that Rurban should be combined with Rural, and that Rural should appear before Urban, we can simply modify the code as such: example = TFEQ_data %&gt;% mutate(Area = factor(`Living area`, levels=c(2,3,1), labels=c(&quot;Rural&quot;, &quot;Rural&quot;, &quot;Urban&quot;))) levels(example$Area) nlevels(example$Area) table(example$`Living area`, example$Area) This approach of renaming and re-ordering factor levels is very important as it simplifies the readability of tables and figures. Some other transformations can be applied to factors thanks to the {forcats} package. Particular attention can be given to the following functions: fct_reorder/fct_reorder2 and fct_relevel reorder the levels of a factor; fct_recode renames the factor levels (as an alternative to factor used in the previous example); fct_collapse and fct_lump aggregate different levels together (fct_lump regroups automatically all the rare levels). Although it hasnt been done here, manipulating strings is also possible through the {stringr} package, which provides interesting functions such as: str_to_upper/str_to_lower to convert strings to uppercase or lowercase; str_c, str_sub combine or subset strings; str_trim and str_squish remove white spaces; str_extract, str_replace, str_split extract, replace, or split strings or part of the strings. 9.2.3 Converting between Types When importing data, variables may not always be associated to the right type. For instance, when respondents or products are numerically coded, they will be defined as integers rather than strings. Additionally, each variable type has its own property. To take full advantage of the different variable types, and to avoid wrong analyses (e.g considering a variable that is numerically coded as numeric when it is not), we need to convert them to other types. In the following sections, we will mutate() a variable to create a new variable that corresponds to the original one after being converted to its new type (as in the previous example with Area). In case we want to overwrite a variable by only changing the type, the same name is used within mutate(). Based on our variable types of interest, there are two main conversions to run: - From numerical to character/factor; - From character/factor to numerical. The conversion from numerical to character or factor is simply done using as.character() and as.factor() respectively. Note however that as.factor() only converts into factors without allowing to chose the order of the levels, nor to rename them. Alternatively, the use of factor() allows specifying the levels (and hence the order of the levels) and their corresponding labels. An example in the use of as.character() and as.factor() was provided in the previous section when we converted the Respondent variables to character and factor. The use of factor() was also used earlier when the variable Living area was converted from numerical to factor (called Area) with labels. To illustrate the following points, lets start with creating a tibble with two variables, one containing strings made of numbers, and one containing strings made of text. example &lt;- tibble(Numbers = c(&quot;2&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;9&quot;,&quot;6&quot;,&quot;8&quot;,&quot;12&quot;,&quot;10&quot;), Text = c(&quot;Data&quot;,&quot;Science&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;Sensory&quot;,&quot;and&quot;,&quot;Consumer&quot;,&quot;Research&quot;)) The conversion from character to numerical is straight forward and requires the use of the function as.numeric(): example %&gt;% mutate(NumbersN = as.numeric(Numbers), TextN = as.numeric(Text)) As can be seen, when strings are made of numbers, the conversion works fine. However, the text are not converted properly and returns NAs. Now lets apply the same principle to a variable of the type factor. To do so, we will take the same example but first convert the variables from character to factor: example &lt;- example %&gt;% mutate(Numbers = as.factor(Numbers)) %&gt;% mutate(Text = factor(Text, levels=c(&quot;Data&quot;,&quot;Science&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;Sensory&quot;,&quot;and&quot;,&quot;Consumer&quot;,&quot;Research&quot;))) Lets apply as.numeric() to these variables: example %&gt;% mutate(NumbersN = as.numeric(Numbers), TextN = as.numeric(Text)) We can notice here that the outcome is not really as expected as the numbers 2-4-9-6-8-12-10 becomes 3-4-7-5-6-2-1, and Data-Science-4-Sensory-and-Consumer-Research becomes 1-2-3-4-5-6-7. The rationale behind this conversion is that the numbers do not reflects the string itself, but the position of that level within the factor level structure. To convert properly numerical factor levels to number, the variable should first be converted as character: example %&gt;% mutate(Numbers = as.numeric(as.character(Numbers))) 9.2.3.1 Conditional Renaming? mutate() and ifelse() 9.2.4 Handling Missing Values Ignoring, removing, imputing 9.2.5 Restructuring Data Presentation of the different shapes of the tables based on objectives 9.2.5.1 Variables Selection and Repositioning dplyr::select() and dplyr::arrange() 9.2.5.2 Data Filtering dplyr::filter() 9.2.5.3 Data (Re)Shaping pivot_wider() and pivot_longer() _join() 9.2.5.4 Preparing Data for FactoMineR and SensoMineR matrix, data frame, and tibble. how to check the type? class() how to test it? is.data.frame(), is.matrix(), is_tibble() how to convert it to another format?

R originated as a statistical computing language It has a culture germane to sensory science R is well-supported with an active community Extensive online help is available Many books, courses, and other educational material exist The universe of available packages is vast R excels at data manipulation and results reporting R has more specialized tools for sensory analysis than other programming language A.2 Why R? For sensory and consumer scientists, we recommend the R ecosystem of tools for three main reasons. The first reason is cultural - R has from its inception been oriented more towards statistics than to computer science, making the feeling of programming in R more natural (in our experience) for sensory and consumer scientists than programming in Python. This opinion of experience is not to say that a sensory and consumer scientist shouldnt learn Python if they are so inclined, or even that Python tools arent sometimes superior to R tools (in fact, they sometimes are). This latter point leads to our second reason, which is that R tools are typically better suited to sensory and consumer science than are Python tools. Even when Python tools are superior, the R tools are still sufficient for sensory and consumer science purposes, plus there are many custom packages such as SensR, SensoMineR, and FactorMineR that have been specifically developed for sensory and consumer science. Finally, the recent work by the RStudio company, and especially the exceptional work of Hadley Wickham, has lead to a very low barrier to entry for programming within R together with exceptional tools for data manipulation. A.2.1 Steps to Install R The first step in this journey is to install R. For this, visit The R Project for Statistical Computing. From there, follow the download instructions to install R for your particular platform. https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ Download the latest version of R Install R with default options You will almost certainly be running 64-bit R Note: If you are running R 4.0 or higher, you might need to install Rtools: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ A.3 RStudio A.3.1 Steps to Install RStudio Next you need to install RStudio, which is our recommended integrated development environment (IDE) for developing R code. To do so, visit the RStudio desktop download page and follow the installation instructions. Once you have installed R and RStudio, you should be able to open RStudio and enter the following into the Console to receive the number 3 as your output: x &lt;- 1 y &lt;- 2 x + y Some recommendations upon installing RStudio: Change the color scheme to dark. Put the console on the right. https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download Download and install the latest (almost certainly 64-bit) version of RStudio with default options Adjustments: Uncheck Restore .RData into workspace at startup Select Never for Save workspace to .RData on exit Change color scheme to dark (e.g. Idle Fingers) Put console on right A.3.2 Create a Local Project Always work in an RStudio project Projects keep your files (and activity) organized Projects help manage your file path (so your computer can find things) Projects allow for more advanced capabilities later (like GitHub or renv) We cover the use of GitHub in a future webinar For now we create projects locally A.3.3 Install and Load Packages As you use R, you will want to make use of the many packages others (and perhaps you) have written Essential packages (or collections): tidyverse, readxl Custom Microsoft office document creation officer, flextable, rvg, openxlsx, extrafont, extrafontdb Sensory specific packages sensR , SensoMineR, FactoMineR, factoextra There are many more, for statistical tests of all varieties, to multivariate analysis, to machine learning, to text analysis, etc. You only need to install each package once per R version To install a package, you can: Type install.packages([package name]) Use the RStudio dropdown In addition, if a script loads package that are not installed, RStudio will prompt you to install the package Notes: If you do not have write access on your computer, you might need IT help to install packages You might need to safelist various R related tools and sites A.3.4 Run Sample Code Like any language, R is best learned first through example then through study We start with a series of examples to illustrate basic principles For this example, we analyze a series of Tetrad tests Suppose you have 15 out of 44 correct in a Tetrad test Using sensR, its easy to analyze these data: library(sensR) num_correct &lt;- 15 num_total &lt;- 44 discrim_res &lt;- discrim(num_correct, num_total, method = &quot;tetrad&quot;) print(discrim_res) A.4 Git and GitHub Git is a version control system that allows you to revert to earlier versions of your code, if necessary. GitHub is service that allows for online backups of your code and which facilitates collaboration between team members. We highly recommend that you integrate both Git and GitHub into your data scientific workflow. For a full review of Git and GitHub from an R programming perspective, we recommend Happy Git with R by Jenny Bryant. In what follows, we simply provide the minimum information needed to get you up and running with Git and GitHub.
